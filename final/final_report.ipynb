    "The goal in modeling a large corpus of discrete documents is to find the latent clustering pattern of those documents as we assume that each document has a probability distribution over certain number of topics, and the words in each documents are drawn from documentâ€™s topic distribution. It is hard because we are not sure about the word distribution whether they are discrete or continuous, nor do we have any information about the number of topics in many cases.  \n",

    "We planned to implement the **Black Box variational inference** method (klqp method) in Edward at the very beginning, however if we include all parameters $\\theta$, $z$, and $\\beta$ for the posterior inference, the result cannot converge. Because KLqp has poor performance at approximating the Dirichlet distribution, especially if we have full-rank covariances for the mixture components. This problem is partially due to the high variance in the vanilla version of BBVI.  \n",

(2015)](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P15-1077). Since we are only interested in the posterior distribution over the assignment of words in $k$ topics, we are able to not explicitly express the posterior estimation of $\\theta$ and $\\beta$.   \n",

In order to draw sample at the time t, we need to construct the complete conditional distribution of latent variables, $p(z_{i}|\\mathbf{z}_{-i}, \\mathbf{w})$ in this algorithm. Taking the advantage of the conjugate conditional family, the probability distribution can be expressed as: \n",
