abstract investigate short term dynamics recurrent competition neural activity primary visual cortex terms information processing context orientation selectivity propose stimulus onset strength recurrent excitation decreases due fast synaptic depression consequence network shifts initially highly nonlinear linear operating regime sharp orientation tuning established first highly competitive phase second less competitive phase precise signaling multiple orientations long range modulation intra inter areal connections becomes possible surround effects thus network first extracts salient features stimulus starts process details show signal processing strategy optimal neurons limited bandwidth objective transmit maximum amount information time interval beginning stimulus onset
