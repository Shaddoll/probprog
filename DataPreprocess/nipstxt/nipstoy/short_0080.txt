abstract attractor networks map input space discrete output space useful pattern completion however designing net given set attractors notoriously tricky training procedures cpu intensive often produce spurious attractors ill conditioned attractor basins difficulties occur connection network participates encoding multiple attractors describe alternative formulation attractor networks encoding knowledge local distributed although localist attractor networks similar dynamics distributed counterparts much easier work interpret propose statistical formulation localist attractor net dynamics yields convergence proof mathematical interpretation model parameters
