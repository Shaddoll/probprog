abstract paper revisits classical neuroscience paradigm hebbian learning find necessary requirement effective associative memory learning efcacies incoming synapses uncorrelated requirement difficult achieve robust manner hebbian synaptic learning since depends network level information effective learning yet obtained neuronal process maintains zero sum incoming synaptic efcacies normalization drastically improves memory capacity associative networks essentially bounded capacity one linearly scales network size also enables effective storage patterns heterogeneous coding levels single network neuronal normalization successfully carried activity dependent homeostasis neuron synaptic efcacies recently observed cortical tissue thus findings strongly suggest effective associative learning hebbian synapses alone biologically implausible hebbian synapses must continuously remodeled neuronally driven regulatory processes brain
