abstract study simple stochastic single neuron model delayed self feedback capable generating spike trains simulations show spike trains exhibit resonant behavior noise delay order gain insight resonance simplify model study stochastic binary element whose transition probability depends state fixed interval past simplified model analytically compute interspike interval histograms show resonance noise delay arises resonance also observed elements coupled delayed interaction
