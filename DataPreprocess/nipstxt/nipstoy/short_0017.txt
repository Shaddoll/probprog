abstract spatial information comes two forms direct spatial information example retinal position indirect temporal contiguity information since objects encountered sequentially general spatially close acquisition spatial information neural network investigated given spatial layout several objects networks trained prediction task networks using temporal sequences direct spatial information found develop internal representations show distances correlated distances external layout influence spatial information analyzed providing direct spatial information system training either consistent layout inconsistent approach allows examination relative contributions spatial temporal contiguity
