abstract recent years bayesian networks become highly successful tool diagnosis analysis decision making real world domains present efficient algorithm learning bayes networks data approach constructs bayesian networks first identifying node markov blankets connecting nodes maximally consistent way contrast majority work typically uses hill climbing approaches may produce dense causally incorrect nets approach yields much compact causal networks heeding independencies data compact causal networks facilitate fast inference also easier understand prove mild assumptions approach requires time polynomial size data number nodes randomized variant also presented yields comparable results much higher speeds
