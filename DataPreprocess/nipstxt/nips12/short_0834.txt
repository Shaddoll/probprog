abstract paper propose information maximization provide unified framework understanding saccadic eye movements framework mutual information among cortical representations retinal image priors constructed long term visual experience dynamic short term internal representation constructed recent saccades provides map guiding eye navigation directing eyes locations maximum complexity neuronal ensemble responses step automatic saccadic eye movement system greedily collects information external world modifying neural representations process framework attempts connect several psychological phenomena pop inhibition return long term visual experience short term working memory also provides interesting perspective contextual computation formation neural representation visual system
