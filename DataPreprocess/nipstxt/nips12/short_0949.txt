abstract analysis data recorded optical imaging intrinsic signals measurement changes light reflectance cortical tissue removal noise artifacts blood vessel patterns serious problem often bandpass filtering used underlying assumption spatial frequency exists separates mapping component components especially global signal questionable propose alternative ways processing optical imaging data using blind source separation techniques based spatial decorrelation data first perform benchmarks artificial data order select way processing robust respect sensor noise apply recordings optical imaging experiments macaque primary visual cortex show bss technique able extract ocular dominance orientation preference maps single condition stacks data standard post processing procedures fail artifacts especially blood vessel patterns often completely removed maps summary method blind source separation using extended spatial decorrelation superior technique analysis optical recording data
