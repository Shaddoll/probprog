abstract propose new approach problem searching space stochastic controllers markov decision process mdp partially observable markov decision process pomdp following several authors approach based searching parameterized families policies example via gradient descent optimize solution quality however rather trying estimate values derivatives policy directly indirectly using estimates probability densities policy induces states different points time enables algorithms exploit many techniques efficient robust approximate density propagation stochastic systems show techniques applied deterministic propagation schemes mdp dynamics given explicitly compact form stochastic propagation schemes access generative model simulator mdp present empirical results variants complex problems
