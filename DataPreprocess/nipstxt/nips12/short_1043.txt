abstract problem address paper mobile robot plan order arrive goal minimum uncertainty traditional motion planning algorithms often assume mobile robot track position reliably however real world situations reliable localization may always feasible partially observable markov decision processes pomdps provide one way maximize certainty reaching goal state cost computational intractability large state spaces method propose explicitly models uncertainty robot position state variable generates trajectories augmented pose uncertainty space minimizing positional uncertainty goal robot reduces likelihood becomes lost demonstrate experimentally coastal navigation reduces uncertainty goal especially degraded localization
