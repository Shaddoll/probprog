introduction due large amounts imagery accessed managed via computers problem content based image retrieval cbir recently attracted significant interest among vision community unlike traditional vision applications assumptions content images analyzed allowable context cbir implies space valid image representations restricted generic nature typically low level consequently image understanding problem becomes even complex hand cbir systems access feedback users exploited simplify task finding desired images therefore two fundamental problems addressed first design image representation second design learning mechanisms facilitate interaction two problems cannot however solved isolation careless selection representation make learning difficult vice versa impact poor image representation difficulty learning problem visible cbir systems rely holistic metrics image similarity forcing user feedback relative entire images response query cbil system suggests images user rates images according well satisfy goals search image usually contains several different objects visual concepts rating difficult inefficient user rate mage contains concept interest concept occupies field view remaining filled completely unrelated stuff andhow many example images cbir system see order figure concept interest much better interaction paradigm let user explicitly select regions image relevant search user feedback region level however region based feedback requires sophisticated image representations problem obvious choice object based representations difficult implement
